## 1. Project

![](/src/img/00.png) 

This platform allows the user to apply filters to make their search faster:

* Filter by Species: This filter will only show the characters on the screen either by species such as "human", "alien", "animal", etc.

* Filter by Status: This filter will only show characters on the screen either by status such as "alive", "dead", "unknown"

* Filter by Gender: This filter will only show the characters by gender "male", "female", "unknown".

* Filter by Type: This filter will only show characters by type such as "centaur", "clone", "dog".

 It will also allow them to order the characters in the series alphabetically, the user can define:

* If the order will be ascending (A-Z).
* If the order will be descending (Z-A).

The application allows you to combine the use of both filters in the same search. This could be very useful when user searches for characters with specific characteristics and reduce the search time. 

**Duration:** 4 weeks.

**Tools:** 
* HTML
* CSS
* Java Script

## 2. Context

Thinking of all the fans of the Rick and Morty series who would like to identify the characters, in order to understand the series, this platform was created, which allows users to view a technical sheet of the characters they want, without import the chapter, specie,gender,or universe in which they are. 

## 3. Usability

### Example:

![](/src/img/01.gif)

## 6. Prototypes

We define the prototypes (mobile and desktop), according to a color palette, font type and assets according to the television series. The prototypes were made collaboratively with the Figma tool.

Prototypes for mobile and desktop.
